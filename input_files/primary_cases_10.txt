#line_format
# Format is:
# start end attempts [ strain [ prob [ min [ lat lon radius ] ] ] ]
#
# Only the first three fields are mandatory.  The others are optional, but, if
# present, must be given in the order above.  If a location is specified, then
# all three location fields must be present (lat, lon & radius).
#
# The radius is specified in kilometers. To disable geographic seeding either
# omit lat, lon & radius or give a value for radius that is greater than 40075
# or less than zero.
#
# example below will: make 100 seeding attempts of strain 0 on day 0, 
# each with attempt probabilty of 1, requiring a minimum of 100 transmissions,
# all selected randomly from people whose households are within 100km of
# the specified point.
